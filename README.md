## Devops Trial Task
# First Part 
You will need to install the following services using Ansible (preferred) or Terraform:
* a complete Gitlab installation
* a functional Grafana/Prometheus installation
* setup access to Gitlab and Grafana using Nginx  

# Second Part
Redo the exercises of the first part, but install it in Kubernetes (You can use minikube)  
**Bonuses:** Installation in Kubernetes using Helm  
**IMPORTANT:** When you finish, please provide the following:  
* access to the installation (for instance, https://13.35.46.34:8000/gitlab)
* SSH access to the server
* access to your source code (files you used for parts 2 & 3). You can provide a ZIP archive for the source code. If you donâ€™t have any server instance to work on, you can provide a list of commands/configuration to be run to achieve the results.

**Other notes:**
* Ideally, use CentOS / dnf as this is our environment at Kameleoon.
* If you can use domain names for Gitlab and Grafana, that's better as well (i.e. https://www.mydomain.com/gitlab or https://www.mydomain.com/zabbix better rather than https://13.35.46.34:8000/gitlab).
* This can take you up to 6 hours and we don't expect you to finish all of it, so please focus on what you can do within these timeframe.
